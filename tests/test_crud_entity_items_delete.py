    Fixture to initialize the Tortoise ORM for each test case.
    
    This fixture runs before each test function, initializing an in-memory SQLite database 
    and generating the necessary schemas for testing. It ensures that each test function 
    starts with a fresh, isolated database.

    Steps:
    1. **Initialize Tortoise ORM**: Sets up an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite://:memory:`).
    2. **Generate Schemas**: Creates tables based on the models defined in `app.models`.
    3. **Yield**: Control is handed over to the test function after database initialization.
    4. **Close Connections**: Ensures that the database connections are properly closed after each test.

    This fixture ensures that tests are isolated and do not interfere with each other by 
    creating a fresh database for every test.
